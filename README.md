GitHub action that will run pa11y-ci against the live site daily.

pa11y-ci is configured with the file [.pa11yci](.pa11yci).

The pa11y-ci commands can also be run locally to generate the same test results:

* `npm run pa11y-ci:home` run pa11y-ci against the home page.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:sitemap` run pa11y-ci against all URLs generated by the sitemap except for PDFs. This command throws the error 'Error: Process completed with exit code 2.' when there are accessibility issues detected.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:output` save the pa11y-ci output in a readable HTML format.
